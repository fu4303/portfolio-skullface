description:  "<p>Vox Media celebrated the introduction of Concert, their latest premium advertising offering, with a big shindig at NYC&rsquo;s Upfronts&#8203;/&#8203;NewFronts 2016. From the first save-the-date to the last cocktail napkin of the night, I collaborated with the event coordinators and executive team to create an impactful, cohesive system across all collateral. The identity stemmed from a literal translation of the &ldquo;Concert&rdquo; product, inspired by gritty silkscreened gig posters &mdash; &ldquo;DJ set by Questlove&rdquo; is one benefit you don&rsquo;t downplay.</p>"
