description:  "<p><a href='http://amynicole.co' target='_blank'>Amy Schwartz</a>, Cards Against Humanityâ€™s Design Director knew my style and interests would be the perfect fit for their latest supplemental card pack about Sega Genesis, Magic the Gathering, Dungeons and Dragons, and general geekery. The answer was a cheerful White Knight, a powerful and babely tabletop-playing mage, and a fun Mario-style type treatment, all on an N64 cartridge. I even got to <a href='http://twitch.tv/skvllface' target='_blank'>livestream</a> part of the illustration process!</p>"
