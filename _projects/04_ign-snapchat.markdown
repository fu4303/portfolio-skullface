description:  "<p>In Summer 2015, IGN became a featured Snapchat Discover channel — one of 20 curated and monetized feeds that go live with new content every single day to a massive audience. The Snaps in these feeds are 10 seconds long, vertical (the opposite of how we traditionally think about video), and must account for incongruent screen size ratios across all mobile devices. I worked with IGN’s production team to illustrate and design over two dozen Snaps that went live in December 2015.</p>"
