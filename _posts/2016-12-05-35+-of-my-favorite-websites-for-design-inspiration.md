<figure class="align-right"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/media/posts/2016/jessicapaoli-dot-com_inspiration-websites-banner.jpg" class="widdo-medium"></figure> “Where do you get your inspiration from?” is a tricky question. Relying too much on the trends in your industry or keeping your head too far into what others are doing can put you in a hole where you’re making aesthetic design decisions based on other people’s work.

Of course there’s Dribbble and Behance, but the popular posts on those communities are almost guaranteed to be an insular circle jerk based on likes. If you keep track of the right accounts, Tumblr and Pinterest can be inspirational goldmines. To keep myself from getting distracted by NSFW gifs or home decor DIY projects, though, I like to stick with a few select curated blogs and galleries. Here is where I go when I need to pull reference images for a moodboard, keep on top of the best of what’s happening around me, glean insight from others’ processes, and look at pretty stuff.
