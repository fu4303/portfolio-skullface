## Listened

*   [Girls — Season 1](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008CFZQQS/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B008CFZQQS&linkCode=as2&tag=skullface0f-20&linkId=ZWDZGGYVPD3TPBX5)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=skullface0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B008CFZQQS): I mean, of course TV is more of a "watch" than a "listen", but I've been listening as background noise this weekend. I watched the first few episodes when the show aired and hated it, like much of the Internet. I'm not going to pretend I didn't give it a try just because of Adam Driver, but I'm enjoying it thoroughly. Lena Dunham is much smarter and more self-aware than I (and many critics) give her credit for. The series is problematic without question, but I think it's worth another shot (…as background noise) if you've previously written it off.
*   [Bodega Boys — #13: Blizzard Baes](https://soundcloud.com/bodega-sushi/episode-13-blizzard-baes): Few things make me laugh harder week by week.
*   [DAOKO — DAOKO](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00UIKPDOK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B00UIKPDOK&linkCode=as2&tag=skullface0f-20&linkId=LT2W2KQIGUPKFROS)![](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=skullface0f-20&l=as2&o=1&a=B00UIKPDOK) I absolutely can't get enough of Daoko. She's 18 and raps & sings poetic lyrics in a sweet soft voice on top of downtempo hip-hop beats. If you are an anime-fan weeaboo, you probably know her from her recent [viral collab with Teddyloid](https://vimeo.com/114099080). Her first major label release from Spring 2015 was my favourite album of the year and her first nationwide Japanese tour is this month. She's going to blow up.
*   [99% Invisible — #196: The Fresno Drop](http://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-fresno-drop/): The history of credit cards, set in a small city in California in the middle of the 1900s.

## Watched

*   [Open Ended — #35: Peach Scissor Eggplant Emoji](https://vimeo.com/150658015) LIVE episode with Sharlene King. We're switching up listen/watch podcast/tv this week, strangely enough! I'm mega biased here because James and Sharlene are my buddies, but this is a fantastic conversation about online and queer dating between people of color.
*   [Masterchef Junior — Season 4](http://www.hulu.com/masterchef-junior): THE GREATEST SHOW OF ALL TIME I CRY EVERY EPISODE AND ADDISON IS THE BEST OKAY.
*   [Limbo](https://vimeo.com/116832892) (2015 dir. by Fangso Liu): The best 15-minute short film [based on a Reddit comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/1v0zxa/wp_a_man_gets_to_paradise_unfortunately_lucifer/cenocuc) you'll probably ever see.
