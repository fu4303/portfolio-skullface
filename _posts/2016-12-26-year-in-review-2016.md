## Word of the year

Throughout [2016](http://jessicapaoli.com/2016/year-in-review-2015/), I focused on the word [light](http://jessicapaoli.com/2016/word-of-2016-light/) to drive my goals, actions, and mindset. It worked for everything (except the way I packed for trips)! Some big changes in circumstance helped me approach the days with a _lighter_ sense of self as I worked hard to make it happen. In 2017, my guiding word is **reach**. Iâ€™m not shooting for _the stars_, Iâ€™m aiming toward Andromeda. I will stretch and flex past the self-imposed and societally-mandated boundaries I created and maintained out of fear. My horizons will grow, closing in on what feels like far-off distances. I will extend what I believe I'm capable of â€” without overextending myself.
