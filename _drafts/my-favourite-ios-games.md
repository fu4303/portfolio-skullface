## Resource management

* [Cooking Dash](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/cooking-dash-2016/id978866413?mt=8) (aggressive F2P, energy system, difficult to advance without spending money) — It’s your favourite Diner Dash experience in iOS form, but it’s made to get you to spend money on in-game currency.
* [Rollercoaster Tycoon 4 Mobile](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/rollercoaster-tycoon-4-mobile/id797639732?mt=8) (F2P) — Lots of tapping without great satisfaction, but it’s perfect to keep you entertained during commutes and bring back a wave of nostalgia.
* [Reigns](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/reigns/id1114127463?mt=8) ($2.99) — You are the ruler of a kingdom who must keep his people, church, military, and finances in order using a Tinder-based card interface to manage your kingdom. Quirky writing with fun Easter eggs; the kind of game you want to play a few times to get every ending.

## Puzzles

### Match-three+

* [Pokémon Shuffle](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pokemon-shuffle-mobile/id1014919815?mt=8) (F2P, energy system) — Battle Pokémon against the game by matching! Daily/weekly challenges, cute art. It’s Pokémon puzzles for free in your pocket, much more sustainable and approachable than Pokémon Go.
* ✦ [Two Dots](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/two-dots/id880178264?mt=8) (F2P, energy system) — Chill and addictive match 3 puzzle game with atmospheric music and cute illustrations and animations. Greatly prefer this version to is predecessor, Dots and successor, We Love Dots.

Match 3 kawaii Disney characters that are shaped like blobs and stack on top of each other, omg.
* [Sailor Moon Drops](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/sailor-moon-drops/id1088134142?mt=8) (F2P, energy system) — The only official Sailor Moon iOS game! Classic casual match 3, nothing special, except it’s Sailor Moon.

## Adventure

* Tiny Thief (removed from App Store, $3.99) — Casual point-and-tap adventure puzzlers requiring stealth. Getting all the collectibles in each level is addictive!

## Unique

* ✦ [Desert Golfing](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/desert-golfing/id902062673?mt=8) ($1.99) — You try to get a ball into a hole in an ultra-minimal side-scroller. It lasts forever and you can never reset your score. It’s near silent with absolutely nothing superfluous. This game helped me from having before-bed panic attacks.
* Does not Commute (F2P)
* ✦ [Monument Valley](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monument-valley/id728293409?mt=8) ($3.99) — Sacred geometry and unbeatable art direction in a head-scratchingly wonderful experience. Worth every cent.
* ✦ [Lara Croft GO](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lara-croft-go/id971304016?mt=8) ($0.99) — Turn-based puzzle adventure in a gorgeous isometric landscape. I was skeptical of this at first, but the Square Enix Montreal team is amazing at what they do. Even if you don’t like Tomb Raider (weirdo) this is an enjoyable puzzle experience.
* [TouchTone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/touchtone/id962133182?mt=8) ($2.99) — Perform wiretaps as part of a government surveillance project using a neat, frustrating, and satisfying puzzle mechanic. The tech-y, hacker-y, NSA aesthetic is on-point without ever feeling cliche.
* [Papers, Please](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/papers-please/id935216956?mt=8) ($7.99, iPad only) — I have no clue how the most boring bureaucratic process of stamping passports is made fun, but this game is a classic for a reason.

## Arcade

* [Peggle Blast](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/peggle-blast/id853834250?mt=8) (aggressive F2P, energy system, difficult to advance without spending money) — The super fun console game bite-sized for your phone. It’s ruined by how aggressive it pushes microtransactions on you, but it’s fun for a little while.

## Words/Numbers

* [Alphabear](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/alphabear-word-puzzle-game/id930003798?mt=8) (F2P) — Charming word game with sweet art direction and a goofy social share feature.

## Mystery

Stay far away if you hate cute anime girls and j-pop.

## TCG

* [Hearthstone](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hearthstone-heroes-warcraft/id625257520?mt=8) (F2P) — Blizzard made a free TCG based on Warcraft lore. New expansions are added seasonally and the design is immensely satisfying.

## Virtual pet

* [Hatch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hatch/id718835727?mt=8) ($2.99) — Cute design, cute pet. You can only play a couple games with it but it's nice to have a lil' buddy to look at and take care of!

## RPG

* [Bread Kittens](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/bread-kittens/id557920341?mt=8) (F2P) — Please just read their own description: “Take a journey into the world of Catlandia where innocent kittens are being brainwashed by the evil ChowCorp and held from their free will!”
* [Kim Kardashian: Hollywood](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kim-kardashian-hollywood/id860822992?mt=8) (F2P, energy system) — There’s a reason why this game grossed over $140k before 2016\. The game mechanics themselves only involve tapping, but it’s still fun as heck to go from total zero working a retail job to jet-setting socialite.
* ✦ [Kingdom Hearts: Unchained X](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kingdom-hearts-unchained-ch/id1086859120?mt=8) (F2P, energy system) — I’m a disgustingly biased Kingdom Hearts fan, but customizing your avatar and completing the hack-and-slash missions (story updated monthly, challenges updated weekly) is a blast for casual 5-minute breaks.
* ✦ [Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/star-wars-knights-old-republic/id611436052?mt=8) ($9.99) — The 2003 Xbox/PC classic was ported to iOS in summer 2015\. It’s one of the best Star Wars games of all time. It’s one of the best RPGs of all time. And now you can play it in one hand.
